# Hydrodynamic model of Conception Bay: MIKE21 model setup, outputs and observation data

## Description

**MIKE 21 Flow Model FM** is a hydrodynamic modeling system based on a flexible mesh approach, used for oceanographic, coastal, and estuarine applications. This repository includes a model setup and 10-year model results for Conception Bay in Newfoundland, Canada as well as observational data, and code for model validation.

This dataset is part of the WaterBench series by DHI, supporting open research on water-related challenges. It is intended for educational and research purposes, including model validation, parameter calibration, and machine learning applications. Results should not be used for decision-making.

Files:

* **README**. Description of dataset with details on citations, data processing, and background information. 
* **WaterBench-MIKE21HD-ConceptionBay.zip**: model setup, input data (e.g., boundary conditions, wind), observational data, and code for data exploration and model validation. 
* **MIKE21HD-ConceptionBay-output.zip**: 9-years model result files `Area.dfsu` and `Points.dfs0` (~16 GB).
