The output data is split into two time-periods (2014-2018 and 2019-2022). The latter time-period includes a spinup period in Dec. 2018, which should be left out when concatenating the two datasets.

Note: You can find more information in the README.md file in the other zip-file in Zenodo. Consult that zip-file for background information on the data.
